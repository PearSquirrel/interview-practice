# Longest Alternating Subsequence

In the longest alternating subsequence problem, one wants to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the elements are in alternating order, and in which the sequence is as long as possible.

One solution to the longest alternating subsequence problem with input

[1,3,3,3,2,1,7,3,6,5,5,2]

would be

[1,3,1,7,3,6,2].
