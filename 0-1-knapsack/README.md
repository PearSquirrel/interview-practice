# 0-1 Knapsack

The 0-1 knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.
