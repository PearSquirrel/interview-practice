# Count inversions in an array

The inversion count for an array indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, the inversion count is 0. The maximum inversion count occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order.

Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j

[2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
